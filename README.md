A basic webscrapper website.

How does it work:
  Copy any amazon or flipkart item link that we want to track the price of and paste it on our site.
  Then an email will be sent to the user that now the item is tracked.
  The user will then get notification via email about the item prices over time: 
    Email updates when the item is at its lowest.
