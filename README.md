TrackerDo is a cutting-edge Amazon e-commerce product tracking application designed to help users monitor product prices, sales, discounts, and stock statuses efficiently. By leveraging web scraping technology powered by BrightData, TrackerDo fetches real-time product data directly from Amazon, ensuring accuracy and timely updates. Users receive email notifications via Resend whenever the price drops, a product goes out of stock, or when prices reach an all-time high. This real-time notification system ensures users stay informed, helping them make well-informed purchasing decisions, especially during critical price drops or stock changes.

How does it work:
  Sign Up Or Log In using google or email.

  Then an email will be sent to the user that now the item is tracked.
  The user will then get notifications update about the product price updates.
